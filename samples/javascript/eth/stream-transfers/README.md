## dfuse Client Library - Stream Ethereum Transfers Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and
showcase how to use [dfuse Client Library](https://github.com/dfuse-io/client-js) to easily stream
all transfers happening in Mainnet in a streaming fashion.

First install all the dependencies:

    yarn install

Then simply launch the development mode to see the end results:

    REACT_APP_DFUSE_API_KEY=<dfuse API key here> yarn start

When running this, a browser should automatically open pointing
to the example. If it's not the case, simply open http://localhost:3000 in a browser.

### Requirements

You will need to have a `REACT_APP_DFUSE_API_KEY` environment variable defined
before starting the development server.

Obtain a free API key by visiting https://dfuse.io.
