## dfuse Client Library - Node.js Example

This project showcases how to use [dfuse Client Library](https://github.com/dfuse-io/client-js)
to easily stream all transfers happening in Mainnet in a streaming fashion.

First install all the dependencies:

    yarn install

Then simply launch the development mode to see the end results:

    DFUSE_API_KEY=<dfuse API key here> node index.js

When running this, you should see token transfer starting to flow through
your console.

### Requirements

You will need to have a `DFUSE_API_KEY` environment variable defined before
starting the development server.

Obtain a free API key by visiting https://dfuse.io.
