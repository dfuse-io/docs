Simply open the `index.<chain>.html` file on your for the
chain you want the quickstart on in your favorite browser.

Before launching the file in your browser, be sure to edit the file

```
# Manually edit index.ethereum.html changing `web_abcdef12345678900000000000` with your own API key

# Open `index.ethereum.html` directly in your favorite Browser
open index.ethereum.html       # Mac
xdg-open index.ethereum.html   # Ubuntu
start index.ethereum.thml      # Windows
```
