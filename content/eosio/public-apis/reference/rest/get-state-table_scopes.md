aliases:

---

Fetches a list of scopes, for a given table on a contract account, at any block height.

{{< alert type="note" >}}
Not to be confused with [/v0/state/tables/scopes]({{< ref "./get-state-tables-scopes.md" >}}) which retrieves the actual _tables_. Paired with this endpoint, you can get a consistent view of all tables in a contract.
{{< /alert >}}

## Usage

Sample request:

{{< example-request id="search-transactions" url="https://testnet.eos.dfuse.io/v0/state/table_scopes?account=eosforumdapp&table=proposal" >}}

## Requesting past blocks

The `block_num` parameter determines for which block you want the list
of scopes for the given contract account's table. This can be anywhere
in the chain's history.

If the requested `block_num` is irreversible, you will get an
immutable list of accounts. Otherwise, there are chances that the
returned value moves as the chain reorganizes.

## Input parameters

{{< method-list-item name="account" type="[AccountName](/eosio/public-apis/reference/types/accountname)" required="true" >}}
  Contract account holding the requested table.
{{< /method-list-item >}}

{{< method-list-item name="table" type="[TableName](/eosio/public-apis/reference/types/tablename)" required="true" >}}
  The _name-encoded_ table name you want to retrieve scopes from.  Refer to the contract's ABI for a list of available tables.  This is contract dependent.
{{< /method-list-item >}}

{{< method-list-item name="block_num" type="Number" require="false" >}}
  Defaults to head block num. The block number for which you want to retrieve the consistent table scopes snapshot.
{{< /method-list-item >}}


#### Response

{{< method-list-item name="block_num" type="Number" require="true" >}}
  Block number used to serve your request. Will be the head `block_num` if it was not provided or `0` was passed as `block_num`, otherwise, will be the `block_num` you've passed in the request.
{{< /method-list-item >}}

{{< method-list-item name="scopes" type="Array&lt;[Name](/eosio/public-apis/reference/types/name)&gt;" require="true" >}}
  The _name-encoded_ scope of the table you are requesting.  For example, user balances for tokens live in their account name's scope. This is contract dependent, so inspect the ABI for the contract you are interested in.
{{< /method-list-item >}}

Here is a sample response, for a request at `block_num: 9000000`:

{{< tabs "state-table-scopes-response" >}}
{{< tab lang="json" >}}
{
  "block_num": 9000000,
  "scopes": [
    "aus1genereos",
