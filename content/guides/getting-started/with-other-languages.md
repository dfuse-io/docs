# Getting Started with Other Languages

gRPC is available for [a multitude of languages](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/).

You can easily call the GraphQL endpoint with those languages after issuing a fresh JWT from our [authentication endpoint]({{< ref "/guides/authentication" >}}).

See the [Protobuf service definition](https://github.com/dfuse-io/graphql-over-grpc/blob/master/graphql/graphql.proto), and the [GraphQL docs]({{< ref "/guides/graphql/introduction" >}}) to get the action going.
